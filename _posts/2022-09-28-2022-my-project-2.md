# Charting in Excel
### You might not think of Excel when thinking about Data Science but Excel can make charts that are useful for Data Science

  For this blog post I imported a txt file called MPGData from my Stat 330 class. To do this I downloaded the file and then went to the Data tab, clicked on Get Data, then clicked on From File, and finally clicked on From Text/CSV where I found the file and imported it. Then I clicked Load to load the data into the worksheet. After importing the txt file my sheet looked like this.

  The first chart that I will make is a scatterplot. To do this I need to select all of the data. An easy way to select all of the data is to select the column names and then do Ctrl+Shift+Down which will select all of the data. It is very easy to create a scatterplot in Excel if you have the right data. For this data all I have to do to create a scatterplot is click Insert and then click on Recommended Charts where one of the recommended charts is a scatterplot which once I click on Ok is created.
  This is a very basic scatterplot so now I will talk about different options for this scatterplot. Once I click on the chart I see the Chart Elements button which has elements such as Axes, Axis Titles, Chart Title, Data Labels, Error Bars, Gridlines, Legend, and Trendline. I will name the scatterplot Weight vs MPG and click on the Axis Titles option where I will name the y-axis MPG and the x-axis Weight. I didn't think that including Data Labels made sense because it looks like this. There are too many points to have Data Labels. I also don't think using error bars makes sense. Using gridlines or not is a personal choice but I chose to not use gridlines. I chose to not use a legend and because this is a scatterplot I added a trendline.
