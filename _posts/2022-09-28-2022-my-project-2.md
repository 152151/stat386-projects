# Scatterplots in Excel
### You might not think of Excel when thinking about Data Science but Excel can make scatterplots that are useful for Data Science
### Introduction
Most people that work in Data Science use Python or R when they import data and create a scatterplot. But, Excel also has the ability to make scatterplots that have value for those that work in Data Science because of how easy it is to make them, and because they extract values such as R-squared and the equation of a line with the click of a button. In R and Python knowledge of programming is required which is another reason why Excel has an advantage over R and Python especially for those that are just learning to program in those languages.

### Importing Txt File
  For this blog post I imported a txt file called MPGData from my Stat 330 class. The x variable is weight of car and the y axis is mpg. To import this file I downloaded the file and then went to the Data tab, clicked on Get Data, then clicked on From File, and finally clicked on From Text/CSV where I found the file and imported it. Then I clicked Load to load the data into the worksheet. After importing the txt file my sheet looked like the image below.

### Selecting Data
  The first chart that I will make is a scatterplot which is a commonly used chart for Data Science. To do this I need to select all of the data. An easy way to select all of the data is to select the column names and then do Ctrl+Shift+Down which will select all of the data.
### Recommended Charts
 It is very easy to create a scatterplot in Excel if you have the right data. For this data all I have to do to create a scatterplot is click Insert and then click on Recommended Charts where one of the recommended charts is a scatterplot which once I click on Ok is created. If clicking on Recommended Charts doesn't give the chart you are looking for you can look to the different charts to the right of Recommended Charts.

### Chart Options
  This is a very basic scatterplot so now I will talk about different options for this scatterplot. Once I click on the chart I see the Chart Elements button which has elements such as Axes, Axis Titles, Chart Title, Data Labels, Error Bars, Gridlines, Legend, and Trendline. There are also Chart Styles, and Chart Filters which I won't go into in this post but they are useful options just like the Chart Elements button.

  I will name the scatterplot Weight vs MPG and click on the Axis Titles option where I will name the y-axis MPG and the x-axis Weight. I didn't think that including Data Labels made sense because it looks like this.

  In my opinion there are too many points to have Data Labels. I also don't think using error bars makes sense. Using gridlines or not is a personal choice but I chose to not use gridlines. I chose to not use a legend and added a trendline.

  Each chart element has more options which can be found by clicking on the plus button, clicking on the arrow to the right of each element, and then clicking on more options.

### Trendline Options
  I think exploring the trendline options will be the most useful for this class. This is what it looks like after clicking on more options for trendlines.

There are exponential, linear, logarithmic, polynomial, power, and moving average. I have chosen the linear option. To forecast outside the data points typing in a value in the forward and/or backward options will extend the line outside of the data points which I did by typing in 1000 points for the forward and backward options.

### Equation of the Line and R-squared
Clicking on Display Equation on chart shows the equation of the line on the chart and in this case it is y = -0.0098x + 51.587. The R-squared can be shown by clicking Display R-squared value on chart. The R-squared is 0.5048 for this line.

### Conclusion
I hope that I have shown that there is value in using Excel for Data Science. Of course R and Python can be used to create scatterplots but I think there are times when making a scatterplot in Excel makes sense and times when it makes more sense to make it in R and Python.
