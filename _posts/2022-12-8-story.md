### Introduction

For quite a long time I have played tennis and watched players on the ATP tour which is the top tennis tour for men. Because of my interest in tennis I decided to obtain data from the ATP tour. I obtained this data by web scraping the ATP Tour website and tennisexplorer.com. Web scraping is something that can be done unethically and I wrote about web scraping ethics in one of my other blog posts. Then I cleaned the data using python which is usually necessary after web scraping data. After cleaning the data I explored the data by creating a bunch of different figures that were useful in explaining the data. This process has been written about in my other blog posts. Now that I have explained what I have done with this data so far I will tell a data story with a figure I created in Tableau

### ATP Data Story

Currently the players in the ATP that are ranked in the top 250 come from countries from around the world but the top five countries they come from are the USA, France, Argentina, Italy, and Australia. From experience watching grand slams there are players from these countries that regularly go far in the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbeldon, and the US Open but none of these players have won a grand slam. Adding up these players from these countries shows 42% percent of players in the top 250 of the ATP tour come from these countries and yet these players have won zero grand slams. This has likely happened only becuase of the dominance of Roger Federer who has recently retired, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. Roger Federer won 20 grand slams, Rafael Nadal has won 22 grand slams, and Novak Djokovic has won 21 grand slams which has prevented players for around two decades from winning grand slams. This kind of dominance has never happened in tennis or in most other sports and it will probably never happen for multiple generations. Interestingly to me in the WTA tour which is the top tennis tour for women grand slams have been distributed to a much longer list of players and there hasn't been any dominance besides Serena Williams who won 23 grand slams and just retired. If I analyzed that data I imagine almost all of the countries with the most players would have a grand slam winner.
